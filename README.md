This repository contains a VHDL example demonstrating a common coding error: counter overflow.  The `buggy_counter.vhdl` file showcases the flawed code, while `fixed_counter.vhdl` presents the corrected implementation. The bug arises from the lack of explicit overflow handling in the counter. When the `internal_count` reaches 15, incrementing it leads to an unexpected value, depending on the VHDL simulator's interpretation of integer overflow.  The solution implements a modulo operation to ensure the counter wraps around correctly.
